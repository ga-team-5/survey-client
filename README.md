## Planning
During our planning process, we as a Team started with reviewing the Project requirements our team was tasked to complete.

We as a Team created our ERD, Wireframes, User stories.

Before the start of each day, we as a Team discussed the progress of our project. We identified what we needed to focus on, identified any bugs that we discovered that we may have missed the day prior.

We established rules for utilizing GitHub to prevent any merge conflicts, for example, we would periodically check on each other to make sure we were making changes on the appropriate branch.

## Process
As a team, we identified our weaknesses and strengths and utilized pair programming to challenge each other to become better.

Every morning we made a list of what should be done that day. Each person on the team was responsible for what they were tasked to do.

Every feature we created had its own branch.  After every feature was created, tested, and reviewed by all members of the team, we pushed, merged and then would all pull under the development branch.
