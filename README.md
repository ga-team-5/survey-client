# "Ask Nicely"
"Ask Nicely" is a web application that allows a user to create a survey. They can create 4 response options for that one survey.  Other users can then log in, and vote on that survey.  The app records how many votes each option has, and can be displayed for all users to see.  Users can view all surveys that have been created, and vote on them. A user can also update and delete there own survey, but not others.

## Planning
During our planning process, we as a Team started with reviewing the Project requirements our team was tasked to complete.

We as a Team created our ERD, Wireframes, User stories.

Before the start of each day, we as a Team discussed the progress of our project. We identified what we needed to focus on, identified any bugs that we discovered that we may have missed the day prior.

We established rules for utilizing GitHub to prevent any merge conflicts, for example, we would periodically check on each other to make sure we were making changes on the appropriate branch.

## Process
As a team, we identified our weaknesses and strengths and utilized pair programming to challenge each other to become better.

Every morning we made a list of what should be done that day. Each person on the team was responsible for what they were tasked to do.

Every feature we created had its own branch.  After every feature was created, tested, and reviewed by all members of the team, we pushed, merged and then would all pull under the development branch.

If we had any problems with our code, we utilized websites such as stackoverflow, w3schools, and framework docs to try and solve the problem.  If we could not fix the problem, we then opened an issue in the issue que.

## Plans for Future Improvements
Update surveys in real time
Generate random url for each survey
Implement graph percentages for the vote results
